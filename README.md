⚠️Disclaimer: I am in no way associated with <b>OBI</b> and this is <b>not</b> an official game!!!⚠️

I used <a href="https://bitmidi.com/">bitmidi.com</a> to find midi versions of the two songs used in the OBI advertisments: "GALA - Freed from desire" and "Backstreet Boys - Everybody (Backstreet's Back)".

With the help of <a href="https://meme.institute/gxscc/">GXSCC</a> I exported the tracks to be usable in Unity.

The soundeffects for the game are downloaded from <a href="https://freesound.org/">freesound.org</a>.

I created all the pixelart by myself with <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/">Aseprite</a>.

Further Description is in progress and will be available soon...
